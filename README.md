### Introduction

The Movie Recommendation System is an exciting project that utilizes Python, Pandas, and DeepNote to build a personalized movie recommendation engine. This system analyzes user preferences and recommends movies based on their past ratings and similarities with other users. This article will guide you through the process of setting up and running the recommendation system.

### Installation and Setup

To get started with the Movie Recommendation System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pandas
   ```
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook using DeepNote:
   - Open [Notebook 1](https://deepnote.com/workspace/username/project/movie-recommendation-system/notebook/Notebook%201) for data preprocessing.
   - Open [Notebook 2](https://deepnote.com/workspace/username/project/movie-recommendation-system/notebook/Notebook%202) for model building and evaluation.

### Dataset

The MovieLens dataset is used in this project, containing a large number of movie ratings provided by users. The dataset consists of two CSV files: `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv`. The `movies.csv` file contains movie information, including movie ID and title, while the `ratings.csv` file contains user ratings for each movie.

### Data Preprocessing

In [Notebook 1](https://deepnote.com/workspace/username/project/movie-recommendation-system/notebook/Notebook%201), we preprocess the dataset by performing the following steps:

1. Load the movie and rating data using Pandas.
2. Perform data cleaning and handle missing values, if any.
3. Merge the movie and rating data based on the movie ID.
4. Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.

### Building the Recommendation Model

In [Notebook 2](https://deepnote.com/workspace/username/project/movie-recommendation-system/notebook/Notebook%202), we build and evaluate the recommendation model using collaborative filtering. The steps involved are as follows:

1. Perform train-test split to divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Build the user-item matrix to represent user ratings.
3. Implement collaborative filtering algorithms, such as user-based or item-based filtering.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### Conclusion

The Movie Recommendation System is a powerful tool for providing personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can set up the recommendation system using Python, Pandas, and DeepNote. The collaborative filtering approach ensures accurate and relevant movie suggestions, enhancing the user experience.
